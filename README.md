# Introduction of machine-translation
=====================================

This is an initiation of machine translation (machine-learning) using "text alignment" methode.

Text alignment in parallel for 2 languages : 

"Labelling" (IBM alignment model 1)

"Sampling" (by Gibbs Sampling) : for each parallel sentences, check all alingment posibilities from a source word to taget word, and compare probabilities.
